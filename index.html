		<p>Riding the wind like a kite. Lifting you, it pulls you into it's care. Taking you where you need to go like a river guides water. The slope of the vally funnels the days rainwater into the bed, feeding the forrest below. Where in the belly of the world lies the heart of all life. Gathering souls as time ticks by, lending dreams to soliders destined to return. Never spent, only savoured and protected in wait. The string is not cut, only unravelled too fast letting the end flick up in the air where it drifts to the forrest floor, dead.</p>
		
		<p>Sprouting up from the ground, you pierce the undergrowth. Eager in your journey to reach the moon. All around you new flowers gaze at the sun, their petals agape in awe at their parent. The statue of all life standing tall and proud governs the creatures. Towering as an umbrella from the sky. A lone ray protrudes down between the cross. What is beyond that blue?</p>
		
		<p>Messy rocks surround you with chords connecting them. No knowlege of their path, each filled with disguised ways. Ants and bugs every single one of them. A collony of creatures that are ready to enter the darkness beyond. Revealed in the air is the glory of the truth previously uknowen. With enlightenment achieved, they leave the dropplet.</p>
		
		<p>Waves hunt down the beach, ruthless in their persistence. The beach of naiveity, made from the dust of historys uknowen. A single sand particle stands tall among the rest, indistinguishable. Standing upon the beach this whole time you were. Outside the sand you only see the treasure that was there all along. Walking up the beach with feet new to land, where the ocean body meets the new cycle. From a beginning to a different end, back to back along the line. Up into the vally where the walls meet the flow of time you travel against your home and against that which made you. Seeking your source you mean not to comfront, only to do what has been done before you, and forever again before. The rain falls and so do you, into the belly of the world.</p>
